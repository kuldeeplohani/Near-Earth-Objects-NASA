# NEO by NASA
Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky, airless remnants left over from the early formation of our solar system about 4.6 billion years ago.

The total mass of all the asteroids in the main asteroid belt combined is less than that of Earth's Moon.

Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun. Although asteroids orbit the Sun like planets, they are much smaller than planets.
There are lots of asteroids in our solar system. Most of them are located in the main asteroid belt â€“ a region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

Some asteroids go in front of and behind Jupiter. These are called Trojan asteroids. Asteroids that come close to Earth are called Near Earth Objects, NEOs for short. NASA keeps a close watch on NEOs.

Asteroids are left over from the formation of our solar system.

# Near Earth Objects by NASA
NEO stands for Near-Earth Object. It refers to any asteroid or comet whose orbit around the Sun takes it close to Earth's orbit. NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is the US government agency responsible for the civilian space program, aeronautics research, and aerospace technology.

NASA actively tracks and studies NEOs in order to better understand their orbits, composition, and potential hazards to Earth. NASA's NEO Observations Program uses ground-based telescopes and space-based assets to detect, track, and characterize NEOs. This information is used to determine whether a NEO poses a threat of impact with Earth, and to develop strategies to mitigate that threat if necessary.

NASA is also working on a variety of missions to study and potentially deflect NEOs, including the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission, which will test a technique for deflecting an asteroid off its collision course with Earth, and the Near Earth Object Surveillance Mission (NEOSM), which aims to detect and track a large number of NEOs to improve our understanding of their properties and behavior.

Here we analyzed and made a project on Near Earth Objects. Data analysis and statistical interference is performed on a kaggle dataset which has a data on Near Earth Objects. There are 90836 rows and 10 columns in this dataset. Dataset of this particular project is available here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sameepvani/nasa-nearest-earth-objects.
